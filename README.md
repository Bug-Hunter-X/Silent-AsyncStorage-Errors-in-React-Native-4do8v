# Silent AsyncStorage Errors in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common but tricky bug in React Native involving AsyncStorage and provides a solution. The bug is characterized by the lack of visible error messages when AsyncStorage operations fail. Data might not be stored or retrieved correctly, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Description
AsyncStorage operations (setItem, getItem, etc.) return promises. If these promises are not handled correctly (using `.then` and `.catch` or `async/await`), errors might go unnoticed, leading to seemingly random data inconsistencies.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app on a simulator or device.
4. Observe the potentially unpredictable behavior of data storage and retrieval.

## Solution
The solution involves consistently handling the promises returned by AsyncStorage using either `.then/.catch` or `async/await` to gracefully handle potential errors and provide feedback.

## Additional Notes
This example highlights the importance of robust error handling, especially when working with asynchronous operations in React Native.  Always handle promises to prevent silent failures and improve the overall stability and reliability of your application.
