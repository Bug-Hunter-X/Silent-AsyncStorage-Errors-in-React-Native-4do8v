This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native and attempting to store or retrieve data asynchronously without properly handling the promise or async/await.  It usually manifests as a silent failureâ€”your app doesn't crash, but the data isn't stored or retrieved correctly. This can be very difficult to debug because there aren't obvious error messages.  The problem often lies in neglecting to handle potential rejection of the promises returned by AsyncStorage methods like `setItem` and `getItem`.
